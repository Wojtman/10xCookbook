# AI Rules for 10xCookBook

## Project Description

10xCookbook is an Astro + React powered MVP enabling amateur chefs to
quickly capture, organize, and refine their favorite recipes in personal themed cookbooks. Users create cookbooks (e.g., vegan, gluten-free) and add recipes with titles, images, descriptions, ingredients, and CRUD actions, assisted by AI that parses pasted raw text and optimizes or adapts recipes to dietary preferences. Cookbooks can be drafted anonymously; registration is required to persist and save them.

## Tech Stack

- Astro 5
- TypeScript 5
- React 19
- Tailwind 4
- Shadcn/ui

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Use feedback from linters to improve the code when making changes.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
